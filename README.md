Electric Vehicle data anlysis using Tableau
KPI’S Requirement

 Total Vehicles:
 
1.Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

2. Average Electric Range:Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.

4. Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

5. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.

6. Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.


Dashboard 1: PHEV Insights
📊 Overview
Total Vehicles: 33,672

EV Type: 100% PHEV

Average Electric Range: 30.65 miles

Total BEV Vehicles: 0

📈 Trend by Model Year
Sales increased significantly between 2011 and 2023, peaking at 6K in 2023.

A sharp drop in 2024 indicates either incomplete data or a potential market shift.

🗺️ Geographic Distribution
California dominates: 33,553 vehicles (~99.6% of total PHEVs).

Very low PHEV penetration in other states.

NIRO (KIA): 1,022 units

PACIFICA (Chrysler): 2,642 units

✅ CAFV Eligibility

Eligible: 47.07%

Not Eligible: 52.93%

Dashboard 2: BEV Insights (Tesla Model Y Only)
📊 Overview
Total Vehicles: 28,501

EV Type: 100% BEV

Model: Tesla Model Y only

Average Electric Range: 23.26 miles

Total PHEV Vehicles: 0

📈 Trend by Model Year
Steady growth from 2020 (2K) to 2023 (12K).

Indicates a growing demand and acceptance for Tesla BEVs.

🗺️ Geographic Distribution
Washington leads with 28,456 vehicles (~99.84% of BEVs).

Minimal spread in other states.

🏭 Make Distribution
100% of vehicles are Tesla Model Y.

This model alone contributes all BEV records in this filter.

✅ CAFV Eligibility
Eligible: 2,278 (7.99%)

Not Eligible: 92.01%
→ Suggests a need to align more BEVs with CAFV standards.

📌 Comparative Key Insights & Recommendations

Metric	PHEV	BEV (Tesla Y)

Total Vehicles	33,672	28,501

Avg. Electric Range	30.65 miles	23.26 miles

Dominant State	California	Washington

CAFV Eligibility	47.07%	7.99%

Dominant Make	Toyota (23.3%)	Tesla (100%)

Model Diversity	High (multiple makes/models)	Very Low (Model Y only)

📈 Actionable Recommendations
Broaden BEV Model Diversity

Tesla dominates BEVs. Encourage adoption of other BEV models to reduce risk of market dependency.

Improve CAFV Eligibility for BEVs

Only 8% of BEVs qualify — aligning models with CAFV standards can open up incentives and market growth.

Targeted Geographic Expansion

PHEVs in California and BEVs in Washington dominate. There's untapped potential in other states.

Bridge Range Gap in BEVs

PHEVs offer ~7 miles more range on average — a key metric to improve for BEVs.
