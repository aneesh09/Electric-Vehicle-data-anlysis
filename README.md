CHEVROLET	4,890	22.68%
BMW	4,643	21.53%
FORD	3,706	17.18%
VOLVO	1,233	3.66%

🚗 Top Models
VOLT (Chevrolet): 4,890 units (14.52%)

NIRO (KIA): 1,022 units

PACIFICA (Chrysler): 2,642 units

✅ CAFV Eligibility
Eligible: 47.07%

Not Eligible: 52.93%

Dashboard 2: BEV Insights (Tesla Model Y Only)
📊 Overview
Total Vehicles: 28,501

EV Type: 100% BEV

Model: Tesla Model Y only

Average Electric Range: 23.26 miles

Total PHEV Vehicles: 0

📈 Trend by Model Year
Steady growth from 2020 (2K) to 2023 (12K).

Indicates a growing demand and acceptance for Tesla BEVs.

🗺️ Geographic Distribution
Washington leads with 28,456 vehicles (~99.84% of BEVs).

Minimal spread in other states.

🏭 Make Distribution
100% of vehicles are Tesla Model Y.

This model alone contributes all BEV records in this filter.

✅ CAFV Eligibility
Eligible: 2,278 (7.99%)

Not Eligible: 92.01%
→ Suggests a need to align more BEVs with CAFV standards.

📌 Comparative Key Insights & Recommendations
Metric	PHEV	BEV (Tesla Y)
Total Vehicles	33,672	28,501
Avg. Electric Range	30.65 miles	23.26 miles
Dominant State	California	Washington
CAFV Eligibility	47.07%	7.99%
Dominant Make	Toyota (23.3%)	Tesla (100%)
Model Diversity	High (multiple makes/models)	Very Low (Model Y only)

📈 Actionable Recommendations
Broaden BEV Model Diversity
Tesla dominates BEVs. Encourage adoption of other BEV models to reduce risk of market dependency.

Improve CAFV Eligibility for BEVs
Only 8% of BEVs qualify — aligning models with CAFV standards can open up incentives and market growth.

Targeted Geographic Expansion
PHEVs in California and BEVs in Washington dominate. There's untapped potential in other states.

Bridge Range Gap in BEVs
PHEVs offer ~7 miles more range on average — a key metric to improve for BEVs.
